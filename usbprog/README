General information
-------------------

From <http://www.embedded-projects.net/index.php?page_id=165>:

1. What is USBprog?

   USBprog is a free programming adapter. You can easily install different
   firmware versions from an “online pool” over USB. The adapter can be used
   for programming and debugging AVR and ARM processors, as USB-to-RS232
   converter, as JTAG interface or as simple I/O interface (5 lines).

2. Who needs USBprog?

   Hardware and software developers who work with Windows, Linux and other
   operating systems.

3. What is so special about the concept of USBprog?

   Given time, there will be a growing pool of firmware versions. If you have
   to work with a new module you will ideally find the matching firmware to
   program or connect to this new module in the online pool.

   If there is no matching firmware for the required module you shouldn't
   hastily buy a far too expensive adapter, but ask if it paid to write a new
   firmware for USBprog and thus to invest in the firmware pool. Often it is
   done quite quickly, because you can enhance existing software tools. Like in
   the case of the AVR ISP 2 clone that can be used with every application that
   supports the original adapter of Atmel, or the adapter for the OpenOCD, a
   product developed within 2 to 3 days.


This tool
---------

1. Overview

   This is the programming tool needed to replace the firmware on the USBprog
   hardware. It automatically retrieves a list of available firmwares from the
   internet, downloads them and uploads it to the USBprog adapter.

2. Operating systems

   The tool runs on Linux (primary platform) and Microsoft Windows (secondary
   platform). It should be very easy to port to other Unix-like operating
   systems that have libusb -- including Apple MacOS X.

3. Requirements

     a) libusb <http://libusb.sourceforge.net> and
        <http://libusb-win32.sourceforge.net>
     b) libxml2 <http://xmlsoft.org>
     c) libcurl <http://curl.haxx.se>

4. Interfaces

   The tool consists of a library (written in C++) that manages devices and the
   firmware pool (i.e. the cache on disk) and a command line interface. That
   interface is designed to be used interactively through a shell and in batch mode
   (similar to avrdude).

   A graphical interface is coming. The “old” GUI which doesn't use this
   library is available at <http://www.ixbat.de/index.php?page_id=165>.

5. Installation

   Installation on Linux (or Unix-like operating systems) should be very straight
   forward because it uses autoconf/automake/libtool (i.e. the familiar
   ./configure mechanism).

   For Win32, use the provided binary. If you want to compile yourself, install
   MinGW. Devcpp project files are included. For more information about installing
   libusb on Windows, see the web page.

6. Usage

   To learn how to use the program, just read its manual page, usbprog(1).
   For Win32 users, a HTML version is included.
