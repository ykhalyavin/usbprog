/* Known bugs:

1. device not functional after computer hibernation

When the device is attached and the computer is hibernated
and then woken up again, the computer does not seem to want to talk to the device
anymore. I do not know what to do about this. Other devices (like my mouse) seem to 
survive the same thing OK, so it must be the device, but what is it? Enabling/disabling
the device in device manager brings it into stop and wakes it up again as expected. The 
computer cuts power to the device during hibernation, what is it expecting??
